# (pro)jects

> A better UI for GitHub Projects ðŸ’»

As an author of a podcast, I always wanted to have a place to put my all thoughts in. As a programmer, I wanted it, to have markdown support and excellent integration with tools I love.
The best soultion are of course GitHub Projects, but they have a small problem - the UI is ugly, there's no reliable editor for markdown in there, and it's hard to read on smaller screens.
That's why I created (pro)jects.
